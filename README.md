# Beer Me

This project will focus on being able to catalogue beers you may have tried. It will allow users to input beers they tried with various specs and give commentary about their experience for reference. Since this application is specifically designed to work on the users phone it will allow the user to access their geolocation and find nearby breweries for their next conquest.  If something stands out in style or look then this app will allow the user to access their camera and take a picture to save for later viewing.
